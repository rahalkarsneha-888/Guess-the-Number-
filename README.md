# ðŸŽ² Guess the Number (Mini Project)

This is a simple number guessing game made in Python.

The computer picks a number between 1 to 100.  
You have to guess it â€” and it will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.

### ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- Python

### ðŸš€ How to Run:
Just open the file in Python and run it.  
You will be asked to enter a number â€” keep guessing until you get it right!

### ðŸ“š What I Learned:
- How to use `input()` and `while` loops in Python  
- How to give hints like "Too High" or "Too Low"  
- How to build small games using logic
